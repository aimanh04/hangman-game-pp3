## HOW TO PLAY

The Hangman Game is a simple word-guessing game where the player has to guess the hidden country name letter by letter. The game revolves around a "hangman" figure, and with each incorrect guess, a part of the figure will be drawn. If the figure is fully drawn before the word is guessed, the player loses. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

#### 1. Start the Game:
- When the game begins, you are presented with a choice to either play the game or view instructions.
- If you choose to play the game, you will be prompted to select a continent: America, Asia or Europe.

#### 2. Choosing a Continent:
- Based on your continent selection, the game will randomly choose a country from that region.
- The name of this country is hidden, and it is your task to guess it by suggesting letters one by one.

#### 3. Guessing Letters:
- You input one letter at a time.
- If the letter is in the country's name, it will appear in it's correct position(s).
- If the letter is not in the name, a part of the hangman figure will be drawn, indicating a wrong guess.

#### 4. Winning the Game:
- The objective is to guess the name of the country before the entire hangman figure is drawn.
- The hangman consists of 6 parts, representing 6 incorrect guesses. If you guess all letters correctly before reaching 6 incorrect guesses, you win the game.

#### 5. Losing the Game:
- If you make 6 incorrect guesses, the hangman figure is completed, and you lose the round. The correct name of the country is then revealed.

#### 6. Play Again:
- After a win or loss, you have the option to play again or quit the game. The game will prompt you to enter 'Y' to restart or 'N' to quit.

#### Addition Details:
- You cannot guess the same letter twice; if you do, the game will prompt you to enter a new letter.
- Spaces and special characters are ignored, so you need to focus on the alphabetical letters in the country name.
- You have six incorrect attempts before the game ends, so you need to think carefully about each guess.
